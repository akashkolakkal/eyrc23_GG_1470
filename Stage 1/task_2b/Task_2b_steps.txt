Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2B. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1. We first started with learning the basics about CNN, and watched the provided video lectures.
2. Then we familiarized ourselves with transfer learning, and using pertrained models.
3. We all got together at our college campus and explored various pretrained models and trained them on our dataset to see which fits our task the best. For doing so, we used google colab.
4. We finally decided on using EfficientNetV2L model from Keras Application, and submitted the task for 38.4 accuracy.
5. Afterwards, we explored the EfficientNetV2B3 model and added new images to the dataset from free sites such as freepik.com, which gave us 40 accuracy consistently. Thus we trained the model, ran the evaluation file, and submitted the output zip.
