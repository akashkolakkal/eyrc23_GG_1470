Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2C. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1. First we studied about opencv from the provided jupyter notebook in resources section.
2. As we were on a break from college, we met up online on discord.
3. This task was pretty similar to task 2 B, so the execution was up and running fairly quickly.
4. But since this task needs us to work on 50x50 images, we trained a new model to do the job.
5. Once everything was set up, we ran the executable and recieved 30!
6. We used a colab notebook for training the model, link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C5Z0ujAqbse-6gZHj8pONB3jZO74AYCO?usp=sharing
7. We prepared the zip, created a replica of the training notebook for the task, and uploaded it on portal!
